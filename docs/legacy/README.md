# ProofFlow Legacy Documents

This directory keeps historical design/spec references from pre-hard-cut stages.

- `ADR.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE-REPORT.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `SPEC.md`
- `V0.4-PREP.md`

These documents are intentionally retained for traceability and are excluded from
active runtime/contract validation checks.
